## Daily Planner

## Description

I wanted to create a functional simple calendar application that would allow the user to say events for regular business hours throughout a day. This application is created using HTML, CSS and is powered by jQuery. The calendar takes into account what time of day it is and will change the background color to let you differentiate if your task is in the past, present, or future!
